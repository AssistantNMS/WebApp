The **Assistant for No Man's Sky** is an app that gives users information about the game, such as crafting recipes, refiner recipes, item costs, blueprint costs, a portal library and guides. Almost all of the data is extracted from the **No Man's Sky** game files. This project would not be possible without the hard work of the NMS Modding community and the [MBinCompiler][mbincompiler].

> This app was originally released in early August 2019! The app was originally named No Man's Sky Recipes, when submitting the app to the Apple Store it was rejected due to the name and so the app was renamed. 

After 3 years of development and maintenance, the app was made open source so that the community could have greater control and oversight of what goes into the apps and hopefully some people might want to help fix bugs üòÖ
